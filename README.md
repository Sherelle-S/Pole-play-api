# Pole-play-api

This is an API that details a list of beginner pole dance moves, their fear rating out of 10 (for me,) and the contact points necessary to complete the final pose.



Kit Used:
Javascript, Node, Express and HTML.

The API focuses uses Javascript, Node and Express to explore 'Get' request when building a full stack CRUD application. 

Lessons Learned:
Emphasis of this project was on building an API and getting the server to read our data and return the information requested. Also learned a valuable lesson in fixing a toLoweCase(), which has now been rectified and how to return a name with spaces inside (move[moveName])
